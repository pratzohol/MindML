# Overview

```
Create your own Wiki or digital garden for creating knowledge base
```
Host a simple technical website using `mkdocs-material` for notes and documentation.

Simple yet salient featrues to note are :
- Toggle between light and dark mode
- Search bar
- Support for `[[wikilinks]]`

# Inspiration

- [Notes on AI](https://notesonai.com/Notes+on+AI) is a personal wiki on AI and ML and deployed using `Obsidian-publish`.
- However, it is not free and requires a subscription to `Obsidian Publish` to host the wiki.
- This wiki is inspired by the above and is deployed using `mkdocs-material` and hosted on `Github Pages` for free (You can also host it on `Netlify`, `DigitalOcean` or `GitLabs`).
- Since, everyone loves VS Code, it made much more sense to use it rather than Obsidian.

# Workflow
