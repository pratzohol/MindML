# Python-Stuff

## 1. Overview

This section will contain sub-sections of python libraries which are used for the implementation of the code.

## 2. Structure

The sub-sections (e.x. Pytorch, or Numpy) will have posts which will cover either of the following :

- **Functions** : This will cover functions of the library which are tricky to use and understand. This will also cover the functions which are not used frequently but are useful. I will cover examples of my own by running and testing them so as to understand the working and test the edge cases of the function.
- **Methods** : This will cover methods, i.e., _an ensemble of functions_. Most of the code will be standard and we should try to adhere to the best practices instead of writing the code from the scratch. Hence, I will store the code snippets for common tasks in Machine Learning which are used frequently.

## 3. Tags 

From the above structure, it is clear that the posts will be divided into two categories :

- Function
- Method
