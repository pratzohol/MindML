## 1. Problem Statement

Given a weighted, undirected, and connected graph of V vertices and E edges. Find the sum of weights of the edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree.

## 1.1 What is MST (minimum spanning tree)

A **Spanning tree** is tree-like subgraph consisting of all the vertices in graph. There could be multiple spanning trees. The spanning tree with edges having minimum sum of weights is considered MST.

## 2. Solution

```cpp

```

## 4. Complexity

- Time Complexity --> $O(E*log(E))$
- Space Complexity --> $O(E + V)$
