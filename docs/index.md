# About Me

I completed my Bachelor's from IIT Delhi in Electrical Engineering. I love statistics, probability and linear algebra. I also love to learn about recent trends in Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence. Mostly I have worked on GNNs, NLP and Computer Vision. I would also like to explore Theoritical ML in more depth. Also, I like coding and problem solving.

I'm also an endurance cyclist and runner. Currently I'm preparing for Half Ironman.  
I Seriously need to learn how to swim ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.

## What is MindML?

Inspired from [Notes on AI](https://notesonai.com/Notes+on+AI), MindML is a personal wiki on AI and ML. It is a collection of notes, resources, and ideas on various topics in AI and ML. The search function and simplistic site makes it easy to navigate and revisit the concepts I have learnt.
