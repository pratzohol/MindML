# About Me

I completed my Bachelor's from IIT Delhi in Electrical Engineering. I love statistics, probability and linear algebra, which makes it quite obvious that I also love to learn about recent trends in Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence. I like coding and problem solving as well. 

I'm also an endurance cyclist and runner. Currently I'm preparing for Half Ironman. You can follow my journey on Insta [@woofyluffy](https://www.instagram.com/woofyluffy) (I'm a big time _One piece_ fan also!!)

## What is MindML?

Inspired from [Notes on AI](https://notesonai.com/Notes+on+AI), MindML is a personal wiki on AI and ML. It is a collection of notes, resources, and ideas on various topics in AI and ML. The search function and simplistic site makes it easy to navigate and revisit the concepts I have learnt.
