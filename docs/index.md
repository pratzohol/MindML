## What is MindML?

Inspired from [Notes on AI](https://notesonai.com/Notes+on+AI), MindML is a personal wiki on AI and ML. It is a collection of notes, resources, and ideas on various topics in AI and ML. The search function and simplistic site makes it easy to navigate and revisit the concepts I have learnt.
