# Prompting over Graphs : GraphPrompt

In this note, I will cover the following paper ["GraphPrompt : Unifying Pre-Training and Downstream Tasks for GNN"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08043).

_**NOTE**_ : Definition of [[in-context-learning|In-context Learning (ICL)]] is already covered. I will cover GraphPrompt which is based on Graph prompts. It takes motivation from [[icl-over-graphs-GPPT|Prompting : GPPT]]. Finally, moving ahead from prompting, we will see how [[icl-over-graphs-PRODIGY|ICL : PRODIGY]] introduces ICL over graphs.
