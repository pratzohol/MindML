# Types of Learning

There are broadly 3 different types of learning in Machine Learning paradigm:

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Semi-supervised Learning

## 1. Supervised Learning

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

## 3. Semi-supervised Learning

When we have a few labeled samples and a lot of unlabeled samples, we want to be able to use both of them to optimize the performance and learning capability of our model. This is the definition of Semi-supervised Learning.
