# Miscellaneous

## 1. Overview

This section will contain <u>_miscellaneous_</u>  notes that doesn't come under the umbrella topics of other sections like Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks, etc.

## 2. Structure

Some of the broad topics which will go into this section are:

- Classical ML like SVM, kNN, etc.
- Generic things about ML like bias-variance tradeoff, etc.
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc.

Further, this section can contain sub-sections. For example, if on a particular topic like SVM, I have a few notes, then I can create a sub-section for it.

## 3. Tags

I will make a list of tags which were used for this section. Whatever thing I had in my mind, I can easily look up the tags to check whether I already covered it or not.

Following are the tags which were used in this section:

- Basics
- ICL
- Graphs
