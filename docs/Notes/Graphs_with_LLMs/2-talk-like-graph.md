# Talk like a Graph : Encoding Graphs for LLMs

In this note, I will cover the following paper ["Talk like a Graph : Encoding Graphs for LLMs"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04560.pdf). It provides a comprehensive study of encoding graph-structured data as texts by LLMs.

## 1. Overview

1. LLMs performance on graph task varies because of :
    - Graph encoding method
    - Nature of graph task
    - Structure of graph

2.
