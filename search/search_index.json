It involves two main stages:</p> <ol> <li>Pre-training : In the pre-training stage, a neural network model is trained on a large and diverse dataset, typically on a related but different task. This initial training is called \"pre-training\" because the model is not yet specialized for the specific downstream task of interest. Instead, it learns general features and representations from the data in an unsupervised or supervised manner.</li> <li>Fine-tune :  In this stage, the pre-trained model is further trained on a smaller, task-specific dataset. During fine-tuning, the earlier layers of the model, which capture more generic features, are usually frozen or updated with a lower learning rate to preserve the general knowledge learned during pre-training. The later layers, which capture more task-specific information, are updated with a higher learning rate to allow the model to specialize for the specific task.</li> </ol> <p>CONS : There might be a large training gap between the pre-trained model and the downstream task. This can lead to a phenomenon called \"catastrophic forgetting,\" where the model forgets the general knowledge learned during pre-training as it learns the task-specific information during fine-tuning. This also leads to large fine-tuning time which might become comparable to the training time and hence, becomes computationally expensive.</p>","tags":["Basics"]},{"location":"Notes/Definitions/#secure-multiparty-computation-smc","title":"# Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC)","text":"<p>SMC allows a number of mutually distrustful parties to carry out a joint computation of a function of their inputs, while preserving the privacy of the inputs.</p>","tags":["Basics"]},{"location":"Notes/Graph_Neural_Networks/icl-over-graphs-GPPT/","title":"Prompting over Graphs : GPPT","text":"<p>In this note, I will cover the following paper  GPPT: Graph Pre-training and Prompt Tuning to Generalize Graph Neural Networks</p> <p>NOTE : Definition of In-context Learning (ICL) is already covered.
